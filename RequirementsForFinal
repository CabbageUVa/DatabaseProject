After summary, Prof's requirements for our final project can be expressed like following:
- using more than 10 tables
- taking normalization and denormalization into consideration
	- normalization keeping every table 3NF and BCNF
	- de-normalization why we choose to do this
- trying fancy features like view, assertion, constrain, index....
